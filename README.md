# To-do-app

This application was created using meteor to structure client and server side inputs to create a to do list that a user could input things the needed to do and that would feed into a database on the server end. Users could also cross of and remove task they had completed on the front end. 

This took a while for me to personally understand how the client side and server side interacted and how imports worked but was good practice.
